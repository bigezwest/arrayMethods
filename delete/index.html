    <h4>Demonstrate array method - delete</h4>
    <p>Open console to view.</p>
    <p>
        Notice that although delete removes the element from the array, the size of the array does not change.  This is expected behavior, since it deletes the value from a key: value pair.  <br />
        It would be more useful with use with objects, less so with an array.
