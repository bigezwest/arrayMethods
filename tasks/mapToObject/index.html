<body>
    <p>
        You have an array of user objects, each one has name, surname and id.<br />
        <br />
        Write the code to create another array from it, of objects with id and fullName, where fullName is generated from name and surname.<br />
        <br />
        For instance:
        <code>
        <pre>
            let john = { name: "John", surname: "Smith", id: 1 };
            let pete = { name: "Pete", surname: "Hunt", id: 2 };
            let mary = { name: "Mary", surname: "Key", id: 3 };

            let users = [ john, pete, mary ];

            let usersMapped = /* ... your code ... */

            /*
            usersMapped = [
            { fullName: "John Smith", id: 1 },
            { fullName: "Pete Hunt", id: 2 },
            { fullName: "Mary Key", id: 3 }
            ]
            */

            alert( usersMapped[0].id ) // 1
            alert( usersMapped[0].fullName ) // John Smith
        </pre>
        </code>
        So, actually you need to map one array of objects to another. Try using => here. Thereâ€™s a small catch.
